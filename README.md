# PageTestAutomation
A simple example of automation UI testing by using Specflow + Selenium WebDriver. The target site is https://housing.id.com.au

## Test Strategy
Currently, for a given client site, the test will click on all main menus (left-hand-side), expand and click their sub-menus to load the expected site. The test is repeated for all clients.
